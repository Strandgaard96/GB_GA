2. [Run](#how-to-run)

## How to run

For simple use of the GA install with conda install the env file.

    conda env create --file environment.yml

To run the ga activate the relevant environment and run the following for a quick run on a local installation:

```
python GA_schrock.py --supress_amines --debug --average_size 10 --size_stdev 2 --scoring_func rdkit_embed_scoring_NH3toN2 --cpus_per_task 2 --population_size 3 --mating_pool_size 4
```

## Parameters

This codebase is slightly outdated for the work we do on catalyst design with GAs. For the interested, this is a more robust codebase we are currently using for catalyst design: [catalystGA](https://github.com/juius/catalystGA)
